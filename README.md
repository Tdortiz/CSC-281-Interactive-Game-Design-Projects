## The Arena

This is a Roman arena style game made in Gamemaker where a player plays as the beast. The player, as the beast, must fight off wave of waves of gladiators until your eventual death by being overwhelemed. Balance your abilities and see how far you can get.

My role in this game was to create the player's backend and gladiator's ai. 


## Castle Platformer 

This is a metrovanian style platformer made in Gamemaker where a player explores a castle in order to save the princess.

My role in this game was to create the hero's backend and the enemy's ai. I worked on ai for all of the enemies - bats, melee eneimies, ranged eneimies, and the boss.
