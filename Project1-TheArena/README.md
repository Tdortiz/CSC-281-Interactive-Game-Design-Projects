# The Arena

This is a Roman arena style game made in Gamemaker where a player plays as the beast. The player, as the beast, must fight off wave of waves of gladiators until your eventual death by being overwhelemed. Balance your abilities and see how far you can get.

My role in this game was to create the player's backend and gladiator's ai.
