## Castle Platformer 

This is a metrovanian style platformer made in Gamemaker where a player explores a castle in order to save the princess.

My role in this game was to create the hero's backend and the enemy's ai. I worked on ai for all of the enemies - bats, melee eneimies, ranged eneimies, and the boss.
